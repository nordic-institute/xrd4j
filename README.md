X-Road Library for Java (XRd4J) provides a Java library for building X-Road Adapter servers and clients. The library
implements
X-Road [SOAP profile](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/master/doc/Protocols/pr-mess_x-road_message_protocol.md)
v4.0
and [Service Metadata Protocol](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/master/doc/Protocols/pr-meta_x-road_service_metadata_protocol.md).
The library takes care of serialization and deserialization of SOAP messages offering built-in support for standard
X-Road SOAP headers; only processing of application specific request and response content remains to be implemented.

The library is compatible with X-Road 7.

## Library Modules

* `client` : SOAP client that generates X-Road SOAP messages that can be sent to X-Road Security Server. Includes
  request serializer and response deserializer.
* `server` : Provides an abstract servlet that can be used as a base class for Adapter Server implementations. Includes
  a request deserializer and a response serializer.
* `common` : General purpose utilities for processing SOAP messages and X-Road message data models.
* `rest` : HTTP clients that can be used for sending requests to web services from Adapter Server.

## Maven Repositories

### Release Repository

All XRd4J release versions are available through the NIIS Maven
Repository [https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-releases](https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-releases).

Add the NIIS Maven Repository to your Gradle build file:

```
repositories {
    maven {
        url = uri("https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-releases")
    }
}
```

For Maven POM-file, add the following inside the `<repositories>` tag:

```XML

<repository>
    <id>niis-repo</id>
    <name>NIIS's Maven repository</name>
    <url>https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-releases</url>
</repository>
```

#### Dependency Declaration

Declare the following dependencies in your Gradle build file

```
dependencies {
    // Module: common
    implementation("org.niis.xrd4j:common:${xrd4j.version}")
    // Module: client
    implementation("org.niis.xrd4j:client:${xrd4j.version}")
    // Module: server
    implementation("org.niis.xrd4j:server:${xrd4j.version}")
    // Module: rest
    implementation("org.niis.xrd4j:rest:${xrd4j.version}")
}
```

or in Maven POM-file:

```XML
<!-- Module: common-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.niis.xrd4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>common</artifactId>
    <version>${xrd4j.version}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Module: client-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.niis.xrd4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>client</artifactId>
    <version>${xrd4j.version}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Module: server-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.niis.xrd4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>server</artifactId>
    <version>${xrd4j.version}</version>
</dependency>

<!-- Module: rest-->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.niis.xrd4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>rest</artifactId>
    <version>${xrd4j.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

#### Snapshot Repository

Snapshot versions of XRd4J are available through the NIIS Maven Snapshot repository
in [https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-snapshots](https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-snapshots).

Include the snapshot repository in your Gradle build file

```
repositories {    
    maven {
        url = uri("https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-snapshots")
    }
}
```

or in Maven POM-file inside the `<repositories>` tag:

```XML

<repository>
    <id>niis-snapshot-repo</id>
    <name>NIIS's snapshot Maven repository</name>
    <url>https://artifactory.niis.org/xroad-maven-snapshots</url>
</repository>
```

After this, `x.x.x-SNAPSHOT` versions are available to be declared as dependencies as with release versions above. XRd4J
snapshots are meant for development use only. Use release versions for final adapter implementations.

## Development

### XRd4J Development

Instructions for setting up an environment for XRd4J-related development can be
found [here](documentation/Setting-up-Development-Environment.md).

Javadocs can be generated with the included script `generate-javadocs.sh`. The script will create `javadoc` folder with
HTML documentation.

The most essential classes of the library are:

* `org.niis.xrd4j.common.member.ConsumerMember` : represents an X-Road consumer member that acts as a client that
  initiates a service call by sending a ServiceRequest.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.common.member.ProducerMember` : represents an X-Road producer member that produces services to X-Road.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.common.message.ServiceRequest<?>` : represents an X-Road service request that is sent by a
  ConsumerMember and received by a ProviderMember. Contains the sent SOAP request.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.common.message.ServiceResponse<?, ?>` : represents an X-Road service response message that is sent by
  a ProviderMember and received by a ConsumerMember. Contains the SOAP response.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.client.serializer.AbstractServiceRequestSerializer` : an abstract base class for service request
  serializers.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.server.deserializer.AbstractCustomRequestDeserializer<?>` : an abstract base class for service request
  deserializers.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.server.serializer.AbstractServiceResponseSerializer` : an abstract base class for service response
  serializers.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.client.deserializer.AbstractResponseDeserializer<?, ?>` : an abstract base class for service response
  deserializers.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.client.SOAPClientImpl` : a SOAP client that offers two methods for sending SOAPMessage and
  ServiceRequest objects.
* `org.niis.xrd4j.server.AbstractAdapterServlet` : an abstract base class for Servlets that implement SOAP message
  processing. Can be used as a base class for Adapter Server implementations.

### Adapter Development Using XRd4J

For implementation details and tips for creating an X-Road service adapter using XRd4J
see [adapter implementation overview](documentation/adapter-implementation.md).

Testing HTTPS connectivity may require setting up SSL on Tomcat. Basic instructions for this can be
found [here](documentation/Setting-up-SSL-on-Tomcat.md).

### Compatibility Mode With Older X-Road Versions

To enable processing of SOAP Body elements in compatibility mode with older versions of X-Road protocol, method
`request.setProcessingWrappers(true)` must be called before serialization or deserialization of messages. This means
that request messages must contain `request` wrapper and response messages must contain `request` and `response`
wrappers. To skip automatic procession of `request` and `response` wrappers, method
`request.setProcessingWrappers(false)` must be called before serialization or deserialization of messages, which is the
default. The usage of `setProcessingWrappers` method is demonstrated in
the [the adapter implementation examples](documentation/adapter-implementation.md).
