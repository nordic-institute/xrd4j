# X-Road Example Adapter

X-Road Example Adapter provides an example implementation of a web service that is compatible with the X-Road 6 and X-Road 7. The 
Example Adapter support the X-Road Message Protocol for SOAP version [4.0](https://github.com/nordic-institute/X-Road/blob/develop/doc/Protocols/pr-mess_x-road_message_protocol.md).

The implementation is based on the [XRd4J](https://github.com/nordic-institute/xrd4j) library. The Example Adapter contains 
a single class that implements four services:

* `getRandom` : returns a random number between 1-100
* `helloService` : returns a hello message with the given name
* `listPeople` : returns a list of mock people
* `personDetails` : returns a mock person based on the given `SSN`
* `storeAttachments` : accepts the request with attachments and returns name and size of each attachment
* `getAttachments` : returns the response with attachments. The number of attachments and their size are given in request. 

The Example Adapter is meant to illustrate the basic level usage of the XRd4J library in processing X-Road messages.

## Try It Out

The fastest and easiest way to try out the application is by using the Spring Boot Maven plugin.
To do this, you need to have a working installation of [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/).

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```
After that the application is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

The WSDL description is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint?wsdl
```

## Software Requirements

* Java 8 or Java 11
* Maven 3.x
* Docker (*optional*)

## Development Environment

Setting up an environment for example-related development is explained [here](Setting-up-Development-Environment.md).

## Installation

X-Road Example Adapter can be installed and run in the following ways:

* Deploying `example-adapter-x.x.x.war` into a web container such as Tomcat.
* Using Docker to run X-Road Example Adapter.

### Web container

Build X-Road Example Adapter and deploy it to a Java application server, e.g., Tomcat.

* Build the project and produce ```example-adapter-x.x.x.war``` file.
* Copy the file ```tomcat.home/webapps``` folder.
* Start/restart Tomcat.
* 
### Docker

You can create a Docker image to run X-Road Example Adapter inside a container, using the provided Dockerfile.
Before building the image, you must build the war file.

```bash
mvn clean verify
```
If you have not built the war, building the Docker image will fail with message
```bash
Step 2 : ADD src/target/example-adapter-*.war example-adapter.war
No source files were specified
```

While you are in the project root directory, build the image using the `docker build` command. The `-t` parameter gives your image a tag, so you can run it more easily later. Donâ€™t forget the `.` command, which tells the `docker build` command to look in the current directory for a file called Dockerfile.

```bash
docker build -t example-adapter .
```

After building the image, you can run X-Road Test Service using it.

```bash
docker run -p 8080:8080 example-adapter
```

See [Usage section](#usage) for further instructions.

## Access the application

After installation the application is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

The WSDL description is accessible at:

```
http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint?wsdl
```

## Usage

This section provides examples for calling the service after it is deployed and running. The example commands require `curl` to be installed.

### getRandom

An example [SOAP request](examples/getRandomRequest.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `getRandom` service:

```bash
curl -d @examples/getRandomRequest.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

An example of the corresponding [SOAP response](examples/getRandomResponse.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

### helloService

An example [SOAP request](examples/helloServiceRequest.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `helloService`:

```bash
curl -d @examples/helloServiceRequest.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

An example of the corresponding [SOAP response](examples/helloServiceResponse.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

### listPeople

An example [SOAP request](examples/listPeopleRequest.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `listPeople`:

```bash
curl -d @examples/listPeopleRequest.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

An example of the corresponding [SOAP response](examples/listPeopleResponse.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

### personDetails

An example [SOAP request](examples/personDetailsRequest.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `personDetails`:

```bash
curl -d @examples/personDetailsRequest.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

An example of the corresponding [SOAP response](examples/personDetailsResponse.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

### storeAttachments

An example [multipart MIME request](examples/storeAttachmentsRequest.txt) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `storeAttachments`:

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/related; start=\"<rootpart>\"; boundary=MIME_boundary" --data-binary @examples/storeAttachmentsRequest.txt -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

An example of the corresponding [SOAP response](examples/storeAttachmentsResponse.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

### getAttachments

An example [SOAP request](examples/getAttachmentsRequest.xml) (available in the `examples` directory).

At the project root, the following command will call `getAttachments`:

```bash
curl -d @examples/getAttachmentsRequest.xml --header "Content-Type: text/xml" -X POST http://localhost:8080/example-adapter/Endpoint
```

The response is multipart MIME message containing SOAP response and attachments. An example of the corresponding [response](examples/getAttachmentsResponse.txt) (available in the `examples` directory).
