 * take care of deserealizing SOAP header as SOAP body contains application
 * specific content, and the type of the content is defined by the information
 * included in SOAP header. Therefore, SOAP header must be deserialized first,
 * and then use application and message specific deserializer for deserializing
 * the request data. Application and message specific deserializers must
 * implement {@link CustomRequestDeserializer CustomRequestDeserializer}
 * interface.
